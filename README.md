# Outlier Mining in Criminal Networks: The Role of Machine Learning and Outlier Detection Models
This study explores the application of machine learning and outlier detection models to disrupt criminal networks. By integrating complex network theory with unsupervised learning techniques, the research highlights how key agents in criminal organizations can be identified and removed, leading to the effective fragmentation of these networks. The study employs six outlier detection models, including Outlier Scores, Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, and SGDOneClassSVM focusing on human, social, and mixed capital approaches. The findings reveal that the Outlier Score 1 model, applied within the social capital framework, is the most effective in reducing network efficiency. This innovative combination of computational methods and real-world data from criminal networks demonstrates the potential of these technologies to enhance law enforcement strategies and public safety efforts. The work underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in addressing complex criminal systems.
